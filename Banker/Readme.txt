This is a project that implenting banker algorithm 
This project includes 3 files: banker.cpp, bankerpy.py, and Readme.txt

***********************************************************************

The banker algorithm is implemented using 2 different languages python 
and cpp. Basically, they are 2 different programs.

banker.cpp:
	To compile: g++ banker.cpp -std=c++11 -o banker
	To run: ./banker arg
		where arg is the path/name of the input file 

bankerpy.py:
	This program can only run using python 3. I cannot test it
		on joker since joker doesn't support python 3.
	To run: python3 bankerpy.py arg
		where arg is the path/name of the input file
